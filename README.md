# DELA-CRUZ-Laetisha-P-ECE2112-PA5-

## This repository contains the MATLAB (.m) files for the two problems in PA5.

**The .mfiles demonstrate the fuundamental commands and operators in ATLAB Programming as well as simple introductory programs.**


### PROBLEM 1: TRANSPOSE COMMAND AND ' AND .' OPERATORS
- Matrices A and B were initialized to test the differences between the operators and command.
- transA and transB were used to demonstrate the transpose command.
- dot_aposA and dot_aposB were used to demonstrate the *.'* operator.
- aposA and aposB were used to demonstrate the *'* operator.
- All three methods were able to give the same result.
- The program successfully ran in the Command Window.

### PROBLEM 2: LINEAR EQUATIONS USING INVERSE METHOD AND CRAMER'S RULE
- Matrix A was used to represent the left side of the linear equations
- Matrix B was used to represent the right iside of the linear equations
- The inverse method was done through the use of the built-in MATLAB command inv(A)*B
- Cramer's Method was done through the use of loop n = 1:5. This is so that the process will be repeated for all 5 equations.
- A copy of A was stored in An and the nth column of An is replaced by B.
- The detrimant of the new matrix *det(An)* is divided by the determinant of the original matrix A.
- - The program successfully ran in the Command Window.
